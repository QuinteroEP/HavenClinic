                <p>
                    Shiny pokemon have been a constant in the videogames ever since their introduction all the way back in Generation 2, and now, so many years later, hundreds of trainers have made their goal to collect as many of these coveted creatures. With a spawn chance of as low as 1 in 4096 per encounter, it may seem as a daunting task to attempt to hunt for one, but with the right tools and proper preparations, this process can be greatly improved, and even enjoyed!

            <p>The greatest tool available, as long as you have it, ALL shiny odds are improved by double! For instance, the base chance goes from 1/4096 to 1/2048. However, its difficulty to aquire matches its usefulness, as it requires you to complete the National dex</p>

            <p>Not nearly as useful as the shiny charm, but if you opt for the Masuda method, it'll come in handy. It increases the chance of an egg appearing on the daycare</p>
